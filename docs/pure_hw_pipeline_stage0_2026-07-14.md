# GraSU -> ReGraph Pure-Hardware Pipeline, Stage 0

Date: 2026-07-14 Asia/Shanghai

Branch:

```text
codex/pure-hw-pipeline
```

This note defines the start point and first implementation slice for the U55C
pure hardware pipeline. It is intentionally explicit about what is already
proved and what is not yet true, so later timing claims do not inherit accidental
host-side work.

## Current Proven Baseline

The integration repository already proves these weaker facts:

- GraSU and ReGraph can be linked into the same U55C xclbin.
- The same xclbin can be loaded by the existing GraSU host and ReGraph host.
- GraSU can export the actual post-update device graph after PMA D2H and host
  `merge_data`, and ReGraph can consume that exported graph.
- The host-conversion baseline passes the smoke cases recorded in
  `docs/device_graph_export_handoff_2026-07-14.md`.
- The real combined hardware xclbin recorded in
  `docs/combined_hw_real_validation_2026-07-12.md` has hash:

```text
d4296714739acea95a8f6a2f66e113849f089fe8e026fd72e7ee40c9e56f05b0
```

Those facts are useful, but they do not satisfy the pure pipeline goal yet.

## Not Yet True

The current baseline still has these gaps:

- No GraSU completion-token stream exists.
- No hardware barrier waits for all four PMA writers.
- No adapter reads the live GraSU PMA and emits ReGraph edges.
- ReGraph still reads host-preprocessed edge arrays from `m_axi`.
- The current GraSU -> ReGraph handoff still performs graph D2H, host
  serialization/conversion, and graph H2D.
- Current timing is a valid host baseline, not a pure hardware pipeline timing.

## Start-State Evidence Command

Run this before major pure-hardware changes and after each stable milestone:

```bash
cd /home/chuxiao/grasu-regraph-integration
./scripts/collect_pure_hw_start_state.sh \
  --out-dir .tmp_build/pure_hw_start_state_20260714
```

The command writes:

```text
.tmp_build/pure_hw_start_state_20260714/environment.env
.tmp_build/pure_hw_start_state_20260714/git_state.txt
.tmp_build/pure_hw_start_state_20260714/artifact_hashes.tsv
.tmp_build/pure_hw_start_state_20260714/source_fingerprints.tsv
.tmp_build/pure_hw_start_state_20260714/summary.md
```

Large xclbins and build directories are not copied into git. The script records
hashes and paths instead.

## Interface Facts From Current Source

GraSU update side:

- The final graph lives in four PMA buffers passed as `data_device_1` through
  `data_device_4` in `GraSU/GraSU/src/host.cpp`.
- The four PMA writers are two `process_cache` CUs and two `process_ddr` CUs:
  `process_cache_1`, `process_cache_2`, `process_ddr_1`, `process_ddr_2`.
- Each PMA segment has `SEGMENT_SIZE = 16` 32-bit destination slots.
- A destination with bit 31 set is empty/deleted.
- Host `merge_data` reconstructs `(src, dst)` by scanning `row_offset` and
  choosing one of the four PMA buffers from the segment index.

ReGraph compute side:

- The current SSSP build uses `PARTITION_SIZE = 65536`,
  `LITTLE_KERNEL_NUM = 1`, `BIG_KERNEL_NUM = 1`, and uncompressed edge input.
- `littleKernelScatterGather` and `bigKernelScatterGather` consume one
  `edge_burst_dt` per iteration, where `edge_burst_dt` contains 8
  `(src, dst)` pairs.
- For weighted SSSP, the packed destination word stores local destination bits
  in `[18:0]`, weight in `[30:19]`, and dummy in bit 31.
- For unit-weight SSSP, the adapter should pack weight `1` and use dummy
  records for empty PMA slots or final padding.

## First Implementation Slice

The first hardware slice should target `V <= 65536`, unit-weight SSSP, one
destination partition, and the little ReGraph GS path. This keeps the initial
correctness proof small while preserving the final dataflow shape.

Planned dataflow:

```text
GraSU bin_search/dispatch
  -> process_cache_1/process_cache_2/process_ddr_1/process_ddr_2
  -> four completion tokens
  -> pma_to_regraph_adapter
  -> AXI4-Stream edge_burst_dt, 8 edges/burst
  -> ReGraph littleKernelScatterGather stream-input variant
  -> kernelLittleGSMerger
  -> kernelApply
  -> kernelHBMWrapper
```

The first adapter can emit every PMA slot, including dummy records for empty
slots. That means `part_edge_num` can be the PMA capacity known by the host at
launch time, avoiding a new dynamic metadata return path in the first version.
It is conservative for performance, but it removes graph D2H/H2D and proves
correctness against the real PMA.

Later optimization can compact valid PMA edges and pass a real edge count or
partition descriptor through a metadata stream.

## Required Source Changes

Current integration-branch seed code:

```text
kernels/pma_to_regraph_adapter/pma_to_regraph_adapter.cpp
```

Lightweight syntax check:

```bash
cd /home/chuxiao/grasu-regraph-integration
./scripts/check_pma_to_regraph_adapter.sh
```

This check only proves that the adapter source parses against the Vitis HLS C++
headers. It is not an XO compile, link, or hardware correctness proof.

GraSU kernel changes:

- Add one AXI4-Stream completion-token output to each PMA writer kernel.
- Emit exactly one token after the PMA writer has completed all writes.
- Applied in local GraSU branch `codex/explore-grasu-u55c` as commit
  `25d1bb5 Add optional PMA writer completion tokens`.
- Current patch:
  `patches/grasu_completion_tokens_20260714.diff`
- Lightweight syntax check:
  `./scripts/check_grasu_completion_tokens.sh`
- Current check evidence:
  `.tmp_build/grasu_completion_token_check_20260714_stage2`
- HLS semantics:
  - `hls::stream<ap_axiu<32,0,0,0>> &done`
  - `#pragma HLS INTERFACE axis port=done`
  - write the token only after the final PMA store loop or DDR process loop.

Adapter kernel:

- New HLS kernel, likely owned by this integration repository or patched into
  a scratch build tree.
- Inputs:
  - four PMA `m_axi` ports, same device buffers as GraSU's `data_device_1..4`
  - `row_offset` device buffer
  - `node_count`, `pma_slot_count`, `source_vertex`
  - four completion-token AXI streams
- Output:
  - AXI4-Stream edge bursts carrying 8 edges/burst
- HLS semantics:
  - read all four completion tokens before scanning PMA
  - use `#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1` on the burst emission loop
  - use fixed 512-bit stream payload compatible with `edge_burst_dt`
  - pack unit weight as `1`
  - mark dummy lanes with bit 31 in src or encoded dst

ReGraph kernel changes:

- Add a stream-input variant of the little scatter-gather kernel or guard the
  current `m_axi part_edge_array` path behind a compile-time switch.
- Current integration-owned stream wrapper:
  `kernels/regraph_stream_little_gs/little_gs_stream.cpp`
- Lightweight syntax check:
  `./scripts/check_regraph_stream_little_gs.sh`
- HLS semantics:
  - `hls::stream<edge_burst_pkt> &edge_burst_in`
  - `#pragma HLS INTERFACE axis port=edge_burst_in`
  - keep existing scatter/gather/apply streams unchanged after the edge reader.

Host changes:

- Create one OpenCL context/program from the combined xclbin.
- Allocate GraSU PMA buffers once and pass the same `cl::Buffer` objects to the
  adapter without migrating graph data back to host.
- Enqueue GraSU, adapter, ReGraph, and apply/HBM wrapper with event profiling.
- Record separate timing fields: GraSU, barrier, adapter/ReGraph, apply, and
  unified pipeline E2E.
- Keep the existing host-conversion and zero-cost handoff baselines on the same
  generated inputs.

Connectivity changes:

- Add stream connections from each PMA writer to the adapter.
- Add stream connection from adapter to the ReGraph stream-input GS kernel.
- Keep ReGraph internal connections from GS to merger/apply/HBM wrapper.
- Keep all kernels in one xclbin.

## Correctness Matrix

The first matrix remains:

```text
chain
hot-source
spread
hot-destination
```

For every case:

- `V <= 65536`
- unit edge weight
- same input files for pure pipeline, host baseline, zero-cost handoff baseline,
  and Spine comparison
- CPU oracle checks final SSSP distances
- record source fingerprints, xclbin hash, command, log path, result path

## Commit And Push Discipline

Use this branch for all pure pipeline work:

```bash
cd /home/chuxiao/grasu-regraph-integration
git switch codex/pure-hw-pipeline
```

After each stable step:

```bash
git status --short
git add <changed-files>
git commit -m "<short milestone>"
git push -u origin codex/pure-hw-pipeline
```

Do not force push. Build products and raw logs stay out of git unless they are
small curated evidence files; large artifacts should be represented by paths
and SHA-256 hashes.
